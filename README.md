# terraform-multi-cloud-migrate-modernize-build

This setup provides a comprehensive guide to migrating, modernizing, and building infrastructure in AWS and GCP using Terraform. It ensures compliance with security standards, integrates DevSecOps practices, and leverages various AWS and GCP services for a robust and efficient IT solution. 

This documentation will be invaluable for RTS in planning and executing their cloud migration and modernization strategy.


Step 1: Generate Architecture Diagrams
Option A: Using Terravision

    Upload Your Terraform Code:

        Sign up at Terravision.

        Upload your Terraform code into the platform.

        Terravision will automatically parse the code and generate an architecture diagram.

    Review the Diagram:

        Review the generated diagram for accuracy.

        Make adjustments if necessary to ensure all resources are correctly represented.

Option B: Using Brainboard

    Sign Up and Upload:

        Sign up at Brainboard.

        Create a new project and upload your Terraform code.

    Generate and Annotate:

        Brainboard will generate the architecture diagram.

        Use the tool to add annotations, including cost estimates if supported.

Step 2: Estimate Costs
AWS Pricing Calculator

    Navigate to the AWS Pricing Calculator:

        Go to the AWS Pricing Calculator.

    Add Resources:

        Add the resources as defined in your Terraform code (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs).

        Enter the configurations (e.g., instance type, storage size).

    Calculate Costs:

        Calculate the total estimated monthly costs.

        Save or export the estimate.

Google Cloud Pricing Calculator

    Navigate to the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator:

        Go to the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator.

    Add Resources:

        Add the resources as defined in your Terraform code (e.g., Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, VPCs).

        Enter the configurations (e.g., instance type, storage size).

    Calculate Costs:

        Calculate the total estimated monthly costs.

        Save or export the estimate.

Step 3: Integrate Cost Estimates into Diagrams

    Add Cost Annotations:

        If using Brainboard, add the cost estimates directly onto the architecture diagram.

        Ensure each resource in the diagram has an associated cost estimate.

    Export the Diagram:

        Export the final annotated diagram from Brainboard or Terravision.

        Save it in a format that can be easily shared with stakeholders (e.g., PDF, PNG).

Step 4: Document Everything

    Create a Runbook:

        Document the steps to deploy the Terraform code, generate architecture diagrams, and estimate costs.

        Include screenshots of the diagrams and cost estimates.

    Create a Playbook:

        Provide a high-level overview of the architecture and cost estimates.

        Explain how to interpret the diagrams and use the cost estimates for budgeting and planning.
